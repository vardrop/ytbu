# SET YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY make sure you don't have a slash after the last directory!, insert full path to ensure cron finds it! Insert between double quotes. Make sure the directory exists, this directory is the root of the github directory.

# SET OWN YOUTUBE CHANNEL ID BELOW Go to youtube, my channel, get it from url https://www.youtube.com/channel/###OWNID###?view_as=subscriber Insert between double quotes. ID usually begins with UC

#
# To retrive your client_secret.json open: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=_
# If you don't have one, create a project. Under APIs, Youtube's Data API v3 needs to be enabled.
# If you are not already, go to the credentials page under APIs & Services.
# Ensure, that at the top left the right project is selected.
# Click on 'OAuth consent screen' in the top bar, Enter a name and at the bottom click Save.
# Now, again in the Credentials screen press 'Create credentials', 'OAuth client ID', 'Other', Enter a name for the backup app, click 'Create'.
# You will be presented with your client ID and your client secret. Close that.
# Now under 'OAuth 2.0 client IDs' you will find the client you just created. On the far right there is a download button. Click that.
# You have now downloaded your file. Rename it to client_secret.json and move it in to the working directory.
#
# To install everything, run:
# $ sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip && sudo pip3 install --upgrade youtube_dl google-api-python-client google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2
# ^ Let me know if I missed anything (I'm pretty sure I did, haven't tested it)!
#
# Please run this and ensure no errors occur.
# $ /usr/bin/python3 --version && /usr/bin/rclone --version && /usr/bin/youtube-dl --version
#
# Sample output:
#
# Python 3.6.7
# rclone v1.43.1
# - os/arch: linux/amd64
# - go version: go1.11
# 2018.09.26
#
#
# What to do when you get any errors like 'bash: /usr/bin/youtube-dl: No such file or directory'?
# 1. Identify what is not found. In the above example youtube-dl is not found.
# 2. use 'whereis youtube-dl' to find the path, look for /bin/youtube-dl
#     If you can't find it, then
#       a) you don't have the program installed (empty output), run 'sudo apt install youtube-dl'
#       b) you may also want to try all paths listed
# 3. In this example I found youtube-dl in /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
# 4. change the path above: (inside double quotes, not ending with a slash)
# Python3:
py3="/usr/bin/python3"
# Rclone:
rcl="/usr/bin/rclone"
# youtube-dl:
ydl="/usr/bin/youtube-dl"
# 5. run (in this example) /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl --version (your found path and --version)
# 6. If you get the expected result you are good!
#
# If you still can't get it working, it's probably the program's or your system's fault.
#
# 
#
# If you want to edit how youtube-dl downloads, edit below.
